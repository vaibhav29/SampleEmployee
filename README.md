# SampleEmployee
The application is basically for Employee registration in which all the given concepts are cleared as it is developed in WEB Api .net core and Code first approach as the if there is some issue's while testing the code through test just use postman tool and i will do share scripts along this through changes in appsetting you can check the web api results and repository pattern architecture along with images of output of web api.

Hope I covered all the point related to technical as I haven't develop any test cases so there might be some issues but after all everything is given as per expected.

Steps to Run:
Download Code from GitHub.
Download Postman tool
Changes in appsetting with connection String.
Apply the scripts in your local db.
Push the request to api from postman.
httpget and httppost.

Thanks.
